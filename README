A text README file explaining your design. Your README file should give the graders
an overview of what the purposes are for every class, interface, etc. that you include
in your submission, so that they can quickly get a high-level overview of your code.
It does not replace the need for proper Javadoc!

- we have a MVC architechture
- our controller uses the command pattern. The UI has many buttons, each of which carry out a
specific function that mutates the Frames and Panels in the view
-commands has all our user-input commands, which are function objects that implement ICommand
-controller has the IController and ControllerGUI implementation
-model has our IModel interface and our model implementation.
-our model has one field, which is a map of String to BufferedImage, representing each image stored
in the program, and it’s “in-program” name
-view has just the IView interface and the JFrame view interface
-the JFrameView interface takes in just the name of the Frame, and initializes and stores the
predetermined buttons and layouts.
- through the buttons created in JFrameView the functions are activated and change the Frames
and Panels
- the histogram takes in an image and an int that determines if if it will be a red, green, or blue
histogram
- the GUIFeatures interface and its HandleFeatures implementation include all of the features of
the assignment, and are called from the view

- for assignment 6 we created a new Controller ControllerGUI, a new View JFrameView to
store all of the graphical uses of the program, a new GUIFeatures interface for us to store
all of the features of the program, and a Histogram class to represent a histogram
- other than that, our high-level design was more or less the same

- for assignment 8 level 2 we created a new Command object, MaskImage, and added that command object
to knownCommands in Controllerv1, and added the maskImage() function in ImplModel
