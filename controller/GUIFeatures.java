/**
 * This interface will have methods that are application specific events, not Swing specific events.
 * Every method here is like a request from the userâ€”so everything the user might want to do should
 * be a method. The controller will have a features field (composition!) so it can use this code
 * without having to implement this interface.
 *  Avoid any-view specific classes in the Features interface (what does this mean? who knows).
 * Definitely avoid any mention of Swing-specific events though. The whole idea is that each method
 * here is a high level request from the user, rather than a low-level Swing event.
 * Some events could be entirely handled by the view, and thus GUIFeature and the controller never
 * need to know about them. One example is scrolling a single text file
 * When a features event is raised to the controller's attention, the view shouldn't do anything
 * quite yet, but rather wait for permission from the controller. Features are like requests, not
 * demands.
